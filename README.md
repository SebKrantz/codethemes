# codethemes
My texmate code themes, mainly intended for RStudio.

Currently there is only one theme I called *SK Dark*, which to me is an improvement over the Cobalt theme built into RStudio. If you find this useful, feel free to give feedback or propose refinements. 

SK Dark                    |  Cobalt
