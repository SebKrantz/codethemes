# codethemes
 TexMate code themes, inspired by [*fastverse*](<https://github.com/fastverse/fastverse>) colours, mainly intended for RStudio.

These themes are meant to constitute an improvement over the *cobalt* theme built into RStudio. The dark theme comes in a version with italic comments (as in *cobalt*) or non-italic comments as in the preview. There is also a variant of the theme that uses a brighter magenta colour for markdown code (instead of dark blue used by default).

I'm still working on a light version of the theme. If you find this useful, feel free to give feedback or propose refinements.
